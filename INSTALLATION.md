# Installation instructions

## Full environment including micro-sam (with GPU)

Create the conda environment from `environment-gpu.yaml`. Note: you may need to change the cuda version [here](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/dl-for-micro/blob/main/environment_gpu.yaml#L14).
```
conda env create -f environment_gpu.yaml
```
