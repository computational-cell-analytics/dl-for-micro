    "[Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/) is a recent model for interactive segmentation published by Meta.AI. It can be used for much faster (instance) segmentation annotations compared to previous approaches. We have build some napari tools around it in https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam.\n",
